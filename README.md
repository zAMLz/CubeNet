#CubeNet

A test of different neural network models to try and solve a 2x2x2 Rubiks Cube using TensorFlow. You can see a couple models have been trained. These can be tested with test_mlp.py.

The basic network learned to solve a Rubiks Cube of scramble length 6 with an accuracy of 47%. By also training the network to learn the previous move made, it was able to improve the accuracy of the network 52%.
